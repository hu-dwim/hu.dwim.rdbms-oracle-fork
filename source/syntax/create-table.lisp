;;; We need to distinguish between constraints which can be set up
;;; during CREATE TABLE and those which require a second ALTER TABLE
;;; step:
;;;
;;; While foreign key constraints are nominally part of the column
;;; definition, it is not possible to define both together in the case
;;; where the target table has not been defined yet, meaning that
;;; ordering matterns and circular references need to be dealt with.
;;;
;;; An similar issue would arise for table contents: We need to be able
;;; to separate out table and constraint definition for data import files,
;;; where the order must be:
;;;  1. create table
;;;  2. insert into / copy
;;;  3. alter table add foreign key
