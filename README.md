# What

This is a fork of hu.dwim.rdbms done by the http://knowledgetools.de/ guys
to add an Oracle backend.

# How

This repo was imported to git from darcs at the following
darcs commit: `2010-03-08 14:31:04 +0100 levente.meszaros Package`.
Development then continued in that git repo which made merging
hard, and thus it didn't happen.

# Status and plans

This fork is most probably abandoned by the original authors. The
[link](http://src.knowledgetools.de/tomas/porting/) where it was
originally published is gone.

We are planning to convert hu.dwim.rdbms to git, and then import
and rebase this repo as a branch there for posterity, or anyone
willing to merge the changes into the main branch.
